# natours

This is my course Node Express app using MongoDB. 
It is website that shows tours around the city. 
For now it is only API to access tours form database but in future there is going to be full client app.

## run

To run app use `node server.js` or using nodemon `nodemon start`.
It requires MongoDB service on port 27017 and created database named `natours`.
